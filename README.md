This is the repo corresponding to the paper:

[A generative adversarial network approach to calibration of local stochastic volatility models (submitted)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.02505)




## Documentation 
Will follow in the near future (this version requires tensorflow 1.13 and python 3)

If the environment is set up correctly, the following command should start all computations needed for the statistical test described in the paper:

```console
user@host:~$ python3 stat_test.py
```
